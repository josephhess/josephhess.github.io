When i first started my subscription commerce company – I didn’t understand why most people would need anything beyond Paypal since there seemed to be no pain there. And I certainly didn’t understand why there were so many subscription management saas’s popping up and apparently thriving.  I even read some posts about how Paypal accounts were non-transferable etc. but that wouldn’t affect me since i didn’t expect to build something big enough to sell so so what? Why would I give another chunk of money on top of the merchants  fees when i was in such a tight margin deal anyway and needed every single dime for our business.

For me it was mute anyway since none of the services out there could accomplish everything I needed at the time.  We shipped a physical product on a specific schedule and therefore needed to be able to collect a desired shipping date and selected options to ship a customer and have them repeat and preferable be changeable by the customer. Nothing out at the time did all this but the closest thing we could find was magento with a module added on.  We limped along with some minor changes as we tweaked the business and sometimes gave it a good solid shake-up trying to find customer fit before we spent money and time creating a custom solution that met all of our needs.

After working with all the issues of a stand-alone all-in-one solution like magento and using paypal with it – i never want to deal with either again but absolutely not paypal.  They make me want to scream.  We just discovered more lost revenue due to some weird deal with paypal and how it works for them i will never know.  We will have payment fails with no explanation and sometimes when you go to the ” outstanding payments” section to collect balances it works sometime it doesn’t. When you need to search for a customer or transaction – forget it – it will think for quite a while – sometimes 30 seconds which feels like and hour and say no results – sometimes you can search again with the exact same info and it will show results!! Oh my gosh – when you are in a rush trying to figure out an answer to something that went wrong for a customer and you need to get back to them and you are forced to go 20 transactions at a time through your whole list of subscriptions – wow.

Plus – if you have an issue – get ready to talk to someone overseas who has been given a script and no authority and often will not let you move up the chain of command to get a real result. So – you can bluster about how it’s ridiculous and “would they rather see you leave” but this person doesn’t care and neither does paypal. And the fact is at that point – you aren’t going anywhere anyway becuase of fear of how many of your subscribers you will lose if you migrate them to a different service.

If you can find one of the subscription management services like chargify, recurly, cheddargetter, etc that meets your specific needs DO IT.  It will save your life.  If not, have fun cobbling something together from what exists or learning to code.  If you already know how to code – no worries – just create your dream solution and hope your product idea works out
