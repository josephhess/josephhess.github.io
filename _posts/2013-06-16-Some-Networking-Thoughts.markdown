I gave a lighting talk at school last week on some ideas around networking and wanted to get some more stuff down on "paper".

First and foremost is the idea that going to your local ruby meetups or whatever with only your own job interests in mind is a great way to make yourself the most boring person in the room.  If instead you go with the goal that you would like to leave having made one friend not only are your chances of succeeding much better but you minimize the risk of wasting yours and others' time.  As with anything in life you get what you pay for and if you pay the price of friendship by being genuinely interested in others first you will remain in that persons mind as someone worth knowing.

You also want to be in the "pay it forward" mindset.  Look for opportunities to be of service and look to understand and engage in thier problems, interests etc.  Think about people you have met that you liked. So many times it comes down to how they treat you, whether or not they engage with your interests. If someone makes you feel good about yourself by being interested and asking lots of questions you leave feeling like the person was smart and had good taste. I mean they must if they like you right? :)

DHH gets name-dropped a lot and that got me thinking how it relates.  I suppose we all wouldn't mind being so well known and admired that we were referred to by our initials. But the reason he's so loved is he gave first.  First came rails and then came the love.  If you want to be admired by those around you you will need to give first and get the love later.

Start making those new friends as soon as possible. It will be a lot nicer if friends you have made legitimately have you in mind if a good opportunity comes up than being that person who shows up to every event only able to communicate a sense of desperation and neediness.  Obviously, when you are in dire straights and moneys running out that can be tough but keep in mind how you come across no matter what.  No-one wants to talk to someone when they seem desperate.

Get, learn, and do your very best to remember the names of those you meet.  Greet them by name the next time you see them and remind them of yours quickly to save them from any negative feeling when they can't remember yours.  Have personal name cards to hand out - that will help you be remembered and be top of mind. 

Do not look down on any relatonship, big or small, seemingly related or not.  A huge amount of jobs and I think I even heard most of them come through loose connections not best friends and the like.  This means that the person who has the lead on your next job might not be in the same field or even work for the company you will end up at but they are connected to it somehow. Pretty wild but apparently its true.

Make friends, learn names, be real and think about others first and you will have significantly better chances of finding a great team to work with.

cheers!
