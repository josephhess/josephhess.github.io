		  The YouPayed.us site is a place to get to MVP status with various subscription payment management systems.  I wanted an excuse to work more with api integrations and ajax calls and rails partials and the like and give people a place to compare payment systems thoroughly and quickly.

		  28dayhug represents so many things that I learned while trying to find a business that made customers passionately supportive!
		  Every aspect of the business was a learning experience including customer development, product creation, brand collaboration, and platform selection. I had built 28dayhug out of the ashes of my previous attempt at this business model but this time I went MVP (minimum viable product) all the way starting with only a mocked up unbounce page, a hosted subscription management page, mailchimp and zendesk for customer interaction.  Every day running this business I did what I often find myself doing with learning software - take the problem, cut it into manageable pieces, search for the best solution that also is possible in an acceptable amount of time, implement it and move onto the next issue. This cycle of constant iteration and improvement driven by my customers and by what made the business better, easier, more profitable became my daily routine.

		  While the getjson project is certainly silly it was great to finally get my hands on pulling data down from an api and parsing it and adding dynamically to a web site! Just a ton of fun!!
