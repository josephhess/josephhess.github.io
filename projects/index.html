		  <span>Rent It Forward</span>
		  <br>
		  <br>
			Rent It forward is a site for the times when a user wants to buy something that you only need on a temporary basis.
			They list the item and other users can make offers to buy the item when the original user is done with it.
			This enables the original user to work with a brand new item and the secondary buyer to get a very gently used item for a good deal.
			It's a win for both users!

		  <br>
		  The YouPayed.us site is a place to get to MVP status with various subscription payment management systems.  I wanted an excuse to work more with api integrations and ajax calls and rails partials and the like and give people a place to compare payment systems thoroughly and quickly.

		  <br>
		  <br>
		  While the getjson project from code school is certainly silly it was great to finally get my hands on pulling data down via api call and parsing it and adding it dynamically to a web site for the first time!
