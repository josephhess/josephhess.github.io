		  <br>
		  <br>
			Rent It forward is a site for the times when a user wants to buy something that you only need on a temporary basis.
			They list the item and other users can make offers to buy the item when the original user is done with it.
			This enables the original user to work with a brand new item and the secondary buyer to get a very gently used item for a good deal.
			It's a win for both users!

	  <span>File Share Tool: <a href="https://file-share-test.herokuapp.com">Visit site</a></span>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  File Share Tool is an early rails app for me. A user can upload a file(which is stored on S3) and add a message. Then an email is sent to the recipient along with a link to access the file. When the recipient clicks on the link they have the ability to download the file and the original 'sharer' is sent a confirmation email that the recipient has viewed the link'

		  <br>
		  <br>
		  The YouPayed.us site is a place to get to MVP status with various subscription payment management systems.  I wanted an excuse to work more with api integrations and ajax calls and rails partials and the like and give people a place to compare payment systems thoroughly and quickly.

		  NOTE! This is currently broken, need to update rails and a couple other things.

		  <br>
		  <br>
		 This is the first project I did with ajax requests to an api. You cant actually win a game right now. It just alternates between two nemeses and when one of thier faces appear, their latest tweets appear as well.
		 Trivial and silly all in one place.
