		   <span>Rent It Forward: <a href="https://fierce-lake-75543.herokuapp.com" target="blank">Visit site</a></span>
		  <br>
		  <br>
			Rent It forward is a site for the times when a user wants to buy something that you only need on a temporary basis.
			They list the item and other users can make offers to buy the item when the original user is done with it.
			This enables the original user to work with a brand new item and the secondary buyer to get a very gently used item for a good deal.
			It's a win for both users!

		<p>This app is in progress with the following features to be added shortly:
			TODO:
				<ol>
					<li>Switch to Postgres from Mongo</li>

		  A simple jquery app that pulls in a random word, jumbles it and gives the user a number of guesses to win the game according to the instructions below.

		  Instructions:
		  <ol>
				<li>Select a word length between 5 and 15 letters and click submit</li>

				<li>Then input a guess in the make a guess area</li>
				<li>There are 5 guesses available</li>
				<li>On the 4th guess, if we have a definition available, it will be shown</li>
				<li>Guesses need to be the same length as the clue</li>
				<li>Some clues are two words so a space is included in the clue and solution</li>

	  <span>File Share Tool: <a href="https://file-share-test.herokuapp.com">Visit site</a></span>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  File Share Tool is an early rails app for me. A user can upload a file(which is stored on S3) and add a message. Then an email is sent to the recipient along with a link to access the file. When the recipient clicks on the link they have the ability to download the file and the original 'sharer' is sent a confirmation email that the recipient has viewed the link'

		  <br>
		  <br>
		 This is the first project I did with ajax requests to an api. You cant actually win a game right now. It just alternates between two nemeses and when one of thier faces appear, their latest tweets appear as well.
		 Trivial and silly all in one place.
