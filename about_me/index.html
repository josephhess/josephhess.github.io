  <div class="panel-heading">About Me:</div>
  <div class="well">
    <p>I got into development after starting a small web based business.
    I kept running into tech issues in order to grow the business or make
    features my customers wanted. Outsourcing was problematic and since I
    wasn't technical at the time I had no way of verifying what they did was
    any good. At one point I realized that the people I thought were the coolest
    in the world were software developers and with that realization I decided to
    become one so I shut down the business and enrolled in a code school.
    This led to two of the best years of my life writing Ruby every day as part
    of a team of people I respected!</p>

  <div class="well">
    <p>After that an interior design business I co-owned at the time needed some
      serious help with finances, systems, and staff issues. I went back to that business
      and did a lot of restructuring to make it run efficiently. I divested my interest in that
      company at the end of 2017 after achieving all my goals there. I left the business
      in a state of efficiency and high profitabilty and systems in place to make it much easier to run.

  <div class="well">
    <p>Now all I want to do is write code for a great company with a group of people who
      believe in helping their team grow. I am so excited to add full-stack javascript to my
      skillset and to keep growing in it. I also can't wait to spend some time learning GO!
    </p>

    <div class="well">
      <p> When I'm not coding my favorite things to do are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travel  (I've been to 12 countries, some multiple times, on 4 continents).</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Getting my web-enabled smoker/bbq finished soon hopefully</li>
      </ul>
